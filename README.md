### Important:
TikTok and Bing do not have any numbers in the “Cost per engagement” table in the original source, but Facebook has em, even though the Engagement column is missing from Facebook's raw data. So I decided this was part of the assignment and also calculated the Tiktok and Bing data. In addition, I had an issue with the Twitter data, because the raw table with Twitter data has engagements column, but if you use only that data, the final result is at odds with the source. I have left the calculation based on engagements only, but I need to clarify if I was right and Twitter should be calculated with clicks as well.
